### INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this paper is to establish an understanding of time series analysis on remotely sensed data. Which will introduced us to the fundamentals of time series modeling, including decomposition, autocorrelation and modeling historical changes in Galamsey Operation in Ghana, the Cause,Dangers and it's Environmental Impact. Galamsey also known as "gather them and sell" ( @owusu-nimo2018a ), is the term given by local Ghanaian for illegal small-scale gold mining in Ghana( @ferring2016 )
